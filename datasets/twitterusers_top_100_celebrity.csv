michaelianblack,@PruPaine Then if interest were illegal  so they are indirect victims of interest.,0,0,
michaelianblack,@PruPaine But the housing market reflects the value of interest  so if they want to buy a house  they are forced to pay a different price,0,0,
michaelianblack,@AaronWorthing @PruPaine If you feel a law is unjust and want to change it  you do your best to change it.,0,0,
michaelianblack,@AaronWorthing @PruPaine Of course. We all have to decide for ourselves what is just/unjust  and act accordingly.,0,0,

michaelianblack,@AaronWorthing @PruPaine I refer to my previous statement: I am all for civil disobedience when merited.,0,0,

michaelianblack,@PruPaine Agreed  but taking the pill does not  by itself  contribute to spread of STDs or AIDS but does have pub. health benefits.,0,0,

michaelianblack,@PruPaine By asking for exemptions  the gov't is forced to rule on the validity of each religion  clearly against 1st Amendment.,0,0,
michaelianblack,@PruPaine As far as consistency  it seems to me the Libertarian view should be that gov't should stay out of religion entirely...,0,0,
michaelianblack,@PruPaine I totally agree with this. They should not have to  but I'm describing the law as currently written.,0,0,
michaelianblack,@PruPaine Depends. I am forced to register for the draft  even though I don't want to serve in the armed forces.,0,0,
michaelianblack,@PruPaine I suppose that's correct  so yes  I think they should be forced to pay these premiums.,0,0,
