harrymccracken,@jkendrick That's still my assumption  but there are aspects of all this that still baffle me.,0,0,
harrymccracken,The biggest mystery is why someone's order would show up in my account  but not with my credit card number.,1,0,

harrymccracken,@uSlackr I haven't done that  but it's an interesting idea. (Side note: Best Buy was helpful and efficient.),0,0,
harrymccracken,@shreshthmohan @uSlackr It was $150  so it was probably a really nice router.,0,0,
harrymccracken,@uSlackr Best Buy sent me an order confirmation  complete with name and address.,0,0,
harrymccracken,I'm not sure the Facebook guy is the same one who broke into my Best Buy acount. But he LOOKS like the kind of person who'd steal a router.,1,2,
harrymccracken,Either this guy used his actual name and address to order a router using my Best Buy account  or he also stole this other guy's identity.,0,0,

musclenerd,iOS betas often come out in rapid fire..its far safer for those awaiting iOS7 JB to avoid today's 7.1b1 (they're usually buggy anyway),451,196,
musclenerd,but for those enjoying the 6.x JB  avoid 7.0.4 .  Theres no going back  (always worth saying that for sake of JB newbies),334,140,
musclenerd,Those at 7.x waiting for JB  maybe treat 7.0.4 as exercise in restraint.  Wont affect JB if you slip up  but test your ability to avoid it!,564,236,
musclenerd,@iphonesteven If you've already lost the JB by upgrading to 7.x  then yep it's fine to go from 7.0.x to 7.0.3.,247,93,
musclenerd,7.0.3's lock screen fixes won't impact the JB (unless Apple's holding back here  hah! http://t.co/wI7A4BHZk2 ),485,142,
musclenerd,Potential iOS7 jailbreakers should stay away from today's 7.0.3 for now.  Too early to tell if it closes anything important for JB.,1081,257,

musclenerd,@thespidersden @Shero136 @cammywrites If saved blobs ever become useful again  we'll time it with a JB.  That would then be the reset point,12,10,
musclenerd,@thespidersden @Shero136 @cammywrites right  that's not going to happen. Saving blobs is pointless (false sense of security) after iPhone4,12,4,
musclenerd,@Mikeshugs Not if you want to keep your jailbreak (there's no going back for most devices).  (If you're not JB yet  just run evasi0n now),5,4,

musclenerd,@jackyk0ning nope  Apple fixed that bug in 6.0. But if you have an iPad2 with 4.x and 5.x blobs  you can still use redsn0w to go back to 5.x,9,4,
musclenerd,@olindamr (in other words  it was only the new non-DFU blob fetching in iFaith that was breaking),1,2,
musclenerd,@olindamr fetching blobs from device is what I meant by indirectly using BuildManifest (iTunes used it to put blobs there in 1st place),0,1,
musclenerd,@zoolman88 Those fetched and saved BY Cydia (TSS@Home) are affected too.  But merely saving TO Cydia (uploading) didnt invalidate them.,1,2,

musclenerd,@DinoD7 it will show up on Cydia as "evasi0n 6.x Untether"  out at basically the same time as the app release (unless something breaks),25,10,
musclenerd,@dante_kabbeko it's the form of evasi0n that lets those using tethered 6.1 jailbreak right now untether it using just a Cydia app,4,4,
musclenerd,@mattiadimartino you won't need the power button to work for this jailbreak,4,5,
musclenerd,@lidocayne my personal recommendation would be the downloaded IPSW method  but definitely don't worry if OTA is all you can do,30,4,
musclenerd,There will also be a debian though.  It's less tested than the app but will save you from having to re-install your Cydia tweaks.,180,55,
musclenerd,Before #evasi0n reaches 100%  those with iPhone4 and ipt4g tethered 6.1 JB should now restore to stock 6.1 (but NOT if you use ultrasn0w!),709,104,|evasi0n

musclenerd,@piejanssens @pimskeks a few reasons:  OTA is more time consuming for us to test  and it gives you different SHSH blobs than normal restore,121,26,
musclenerd,Awesome...as @EvilPenguin_ pointed out  we're seeing the final ATV2 6.1 today too.  So ATV2 will be covered by the JB (not ATV3 tho).,245,60,

musclenerd,@sigboe my gut feeling though is that the code behind Photo Stream is riddled with bugs that might be useful on atv3,4,4,
musclenerd,@sigboe thats a valid area to be looking for atv3.  And it certainly uses WebKit too for iTunes Store  Hulu logins etc.  More esoteric tho,2,1,
musclenerd,RT @comex: Its been 8 months since the last time I got to peer inside a jailbreak.  I cant wait,245,0,
musclenerd,@xombie_nerd @Josh_McPherson @pujolsk thanks very much :)  I think this one we can nip in the bud.,1,2,
musclenerd,@TimothyGCA true..but the first tweet from @evad3rs will be a doozy :),41,28,
musclenerd,I know nothing about Facebook  but on Twitter if enough report @evad3rs_jb as spam they'll be removed. (Follow @evad3rs for all the fun!),234,60,
musclenerd,@unicornhacker yes  every other 6.1 device variation will be supported. All TWENTY-TWO of them (omg!). Plus atv2 if it's out in time.,153,53,
musclenerd,@arovik nope  sorry. In fact unless Apple pushes a final atv2 in time  it may not apply there either (*very* likely they will though),2,3,
musclenerd,@arovik not necessarily.  Although atv3 uses far fewer services that can be tampered with  it's not isolated.  But it can't use this next JB,3,5,

musclenerd,@i0n1c I mean the "normal" iOS developer  one who wouldn't go near JB tools to do that :)  But if 3GS baseband differs  need JB tools to DG,13,7,
